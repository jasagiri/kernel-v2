## Free Our Items

In 2018, the idea of NFTs being used in games started to gain traction. This was largely due to the success of [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/technical-details), and with the several startups that started to explore what the technology means for current game ecosystems.

#### A Declaration of the Interdependence of Cyberspace

> Closed Fiefdoms of the platform world, you weary giants of stocks and small talk, I come from the Pluriverse, the new home of the Heart. On behalf of the future, I invite you to join us.

#### Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace by Lawrence Lessig

> [The code] will present the greatest threat to both liberal and libertarian ideals, as well as their greatest promise. We can build, or architect, or code cyberspace to protect values that we believe are fundamental. Or we can build, or architect, or code cyberspace to allow those values to disappear. There is no middle ground. There is no choice that does not include some kind of building. Code is never found; it is only ever made, and only ever made by us.

## Breakout Activity

For this week, we'll be drawing ðŸŸ  circles and â†— arrows. 

Below is Nicky Case's diagram of interconnected systems. We've tried to identify Web 3 concepts and technologies that could be part of each system and have added them beside their respective nodes. 

Where would your product fit in this diagram? Consider which systems your product affects and which ones affect it back.

Don't hesitate to add or remove nodes and arrows. This is just a model to help you think through systems, and there is no correct answer.
