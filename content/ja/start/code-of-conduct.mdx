# Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and stewards pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

<Process>

Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people 

Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  

Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  

Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience  

Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

</Process>

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

<Process>

The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind

Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

Public or private harassment

Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission

Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

</Process>

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Stewards are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Stewards have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the stewards at moderation@kernel.community 

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All stewards are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Stewards will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

<Process>

<Box>

**Correction**

Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

Consequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

</Box>

<Box>

**Warning**

Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

**Temporary Ban**

Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

</Process>

## Kernel Care

<InfoBlock>

Caring harmoniously,  
we create together  
trusted space,  
open - joyfully! - for play.  

</InfoBlock>

Kernel is built on our responsibility to care for one another. Care is primary to all we do: we serve others first; listen with attention, courtesy and respect; speak care-fully; and share or respond in ways which exhibit love and consideration.

As a Kernel Fellow or alum, **you have an obligation to care**.

In many modern constitutions, there are such obligations: South Africa (for instance) obliges her citizens to care for the elderly and the incarcerated. This is quite different from the enforcement of rights, and the question of how such obligations are fulfilled is difficult to describe in static text. One potential answer is “inspiration”. When our leaders act and live in a way which exemplifies the fulfillment of our collective obligations, then ordinary citizens are encouraged to do the same.

We must each strive to be aware of the letters agreed upon here, **and** alive to the spirit which informs them. We honour our individual responsibilities because it is a good way to live. We do so as a means of cultivating ongoing, wholesome relationships with others because we can only live fully when we live well together.
