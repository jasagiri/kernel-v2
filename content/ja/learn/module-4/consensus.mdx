# Illegible Consensus

Following on from [last week's essay mixer](/learn/module-3/remember/), we'll both look back in 
history, and consult a popular online personality for a deeper introduction to internet-age 
institutions. In order to understand our roots, we turn to the Internet Engineering Task Force 
(IETF) and a governance document they ratified in 1992, just as the web was really getting going. 
In order to move through its most modern branches, we'll turn to Venkatesh Rao and James Scott.

### How does this fit into Kernel?

The human desire for legibility is very real: we want things to be at least roughly ordered and to "make sense". But this is not necessarily the way of the world around us. Legible routines are hallmarks of authoritarian structure, yet we also need to find a middle way between the top-down imposition of one man's idea of order and the tyranny of structurelessness. This combination of articles presents such a way, wherein [our own embodied being in a time](/learn/module-3/time) and space can give us the knowledge we need as we need it to keep navigating the [pattern of complementary opposites](/learn/module-0/play-of-pattern) constructively, and always with [humility](/learn/module-3/humility).

## Brief

IETF governance revolves around the simple maxim that **engineering is about trade-offs**. As 
such, we need clear ways of thinking about how we make decisions. We ought to [avoid "majority 
rule"](https://abahlali.org/files/Graeber.pdf) and get to rough consensus decisions which promote the best technical outcomes.

</Aligner>

Rough consensus is therefore a sort of "exception processing", meant to deal with cases where 
the person objecting still feels strongly that their objection is valid and must be accommodated. 
Balloting or looking at percentages cannot "determine" consensus in such cases.

Minority views must be addressed, **with justification**. Simply having a large majority of 
people agreeing to dismiss an objection is not enough to claim there is rough consensus; the 
group must have honestly considered the objection and addressed fully all technical issues.

In a <Link to="https://breakingsmart.com/en/season-1/rough-consensus-and-maximal-interestingness/">different article</Link>, Venkatesh Rao discusses how:

> "Rough consensus is about finding the most fertile directions in which to proceed rather than 
uncovering constraints. Constraints in software tend to be relatively few and obvious. 
Possibilities, however, tend to be intimidatingly vast. Resisting limiting visions, finding the 
most fertile direction, and allying with the right people become the primary challenges."

As with our own [play of thinking patterns](/learn/module-0/play-of-pattern/), the IETF addresses 
these challenges in the negative. They consider issues first rather than agreements; address 
them but don’t accommodate them; and understand (through iterative practice) that consensus is a 
tool and not a destination.

Q: Consensus is a tool, not a goal. We should use it for what three primary tasks?

A: Resisting limiting visions, finding the most fertile directions, allying with the right people.

</Card>

</Flash>

### 1. Lack of disagreement is more important than agreement

1. *Coming to* consensus is different from **having** consensus. In coming to consensus, the key is to separate those choices that are simply unappealing from those that are truly problematic.
2. Closure is more likely to be achieved quickly by asking for objections rather than agreement.

#### 1a. The two meanings of "compromise"

1. Among **engineering choices**, compromises are expected and essential. We must weigh trade-offs and collectively choose the set that best meets the full set of requirements.
2. Among **people**, far less so. Such compromises occur when one group has given up trying to
appease the others. Conceding when there is an outstanding technical objection is not coming to consensus. Even worse is horse-trading: "I object to your proposal for such-and-so reasons. You object to my proposal for this-and-that reason. Neither of us agree. If you stop
objecting to my proposal, I'll stop objecting to your proposal and we'll put them both in."

<Flash>

<Card>

Q: When determining social consensus, should we ask for agreement or objections?

A: Objections.

</Card>

</Flash>

### 2. Issues are addressed, not necessarily accommodated

1. "That's not my favorite solution, but I can live with it. We've made a reasonable choice" - 
this is consensus, not rough. It’s only rough when an unsatisfied person still has an open issue, 
but the group has truly answered the objection at a technical level.
2. This relies on the good judgement of the **consensus caller**, or chair. Finding “rough 
consensus” means that not only has the working group taken the objection seriously, but that it 
has fully examined the ramifications of not making a change to accommodate it, and that the 
outcome does not constitute a failure to meet the technical requirements of the work.
3. What **can't happen** is that the chair bases their decision solely on hearing a large number 
of voices saying, "The objection isn't valid." That would simply be to take a vote. **A valid 
justification needs to be made**.

<Flash>

<Card>

Q: Does rough consensus mean everyone is satisfied?

A: No, only that all technical objections have been answered.

</Card>

</Flash>

### 3. Humming, not voting

1. We don't vote because we can't vote. The IETF is not a membership organization, it's nearly 
impossible to figure out who would get a vote for any given question. There are only “participants”, not “members”.
2. One reason for humming is pragmatic: to **find a starting place** for the conversation. A hum 
can indicate that there were less objections to A than to B at the beginning of the discussion, 
so starting with the objections to A might shorten the discussion.
3. Another is to "take the temperature". A smaller bunch of loud hums for choice A and a larger 
number of non-committal hums for choice B might indicate that some believe that there are serious 
problems with choice B, albeit the more popular by sheer number of people.
4. There is deep symbolism here: a show of hands might leave the impression that the number of 
people matters in some formal way. **It doesn’t**.
5. The formulation and order of questions asked can have huge effects on the outcome. Asking, 
"Who supports going forward with this proposal?", and asking it first, can cause more people to 
hum in the affirmative than would for differently formulated questions, or asking the same 
question after some more "negatively" framed questions. Any sort of polling must aim to prompt 
discussion and questions, **not conclude the matter**.

<Flash>

<Card>

Q: Do the number of votes, hums, or hands matter in consensus-based decision making?

A: No!

</Card>

</Flash>

### 4. Consensus is the path, not the destination

1. **Consensus is a tool** to ensure we get to the best technical outcomes.
2. Experience has shown us that traditional voting leads to gaming of the system; "compromises" 
of the wrong sort; important minority views being ignored; and worse technical outcomes.
3. Again, you **cannot** confirm that there is consensus by counting people, it must be about
the outstanding issues and whether they have been addressed.

#### 4a. One hundred people for and five people against might not be rough consensus

1. If there is a minority who have a valid technical objection, that objection must be dealt with 
before consensus can be declared. This rules out vote stuffing.
2. It's the existence of an unaddressed open issue, not the number of people, which determines 
consensus. As above, you can have rough consensus with issues that have been purposely dismissed, 
but not ones that have been ignored.

#### 4b. Five people for and one hundred people against might still be rough consensus

1. This is the most controversial result. It generally occurs in the case of small, active 
working groups where an objector recruits many otherwise silent participants to their cause.
2. The principle is still the same: if the objection has been addressed, and the new voices are 
not giving informed responses to that point, it can still justifiably be called rough consensus.
3. Sometimes, a show of hands can be useful; sometimes, it can be damaging and result in 
sub-optimal decisions. Sometimes, using a device like a "hum" can avoid those pitfalls; 
sometimes, it is just a poorly disguised vote. **The objective nevertheless remains to protect 
against simple “majority rule” and get to the best technical outcomes.**

<Flash>

<Card>

Q: The existence of what key factor, rather than number of people, determines consensus or its lack?

A: An unaddressed open issue.

</Card>

</Flash>

### The 2020 Take

Most of this is still relevant 28 years later, though there are two points that stand out: this 
idea of a "consensus caller" or chair, and the strange concept of humming.

In remote working environments there is no easy way to replicate humming. Nevertheless, it 
indicates two critical ideas for technical governance systems: voting ought to be about finding 
useful starting places for generative discussion, not reaching conclusions; and sheer number of 
people or votes **does not determine consensus**. 

That said, sentiment analysis of memes on sovereign social media could serve as a modern means 
of "humming". Memetic influence also addresses the issue of a "chair", which we do not - and 
should not - have in decentralized, community-run protocols. While there is no formal position, 
it is also undeniable that [reputation gives certain individuals the legitimacy required](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html) to shift conversations and social conventions.

Unfortunately, it's exactly the authority conferred by the formal position of "chair" which 
gives such individuals the power to **get work done** once all technical objections have been 
addressed. In place of this, we must turn to economics. If we combine delegated voting with 
algorithms like SourceCred, we can determine quality objections and rebuttals more easily. If we 
then plug this into non-linear funding mechanisms, which also act as on-chain economic signals 
of support - as we saw with [EIP-1559](https://gitcoin.co/grants/946/eip-1559-community-fund) - 
we can determine collectively the best technical outcomes.

### Funded code running consensus

EIP-1559 points at something deeper, which is also the reason that the previous paragraph is 
unnecessarily complicated. We were trying to replicate the IETF process, without acknowledging 
that, in 1992, there were sufficiently few people and resources online that it made sense we all 
came to at least rough consensus. Forking the internet in the 90's was not an option.

If the ways in which we signal preference leads to an economic consensus that is strong enough 
to fund a given project, then we should not build governance systems that stand in the way. It 
sounds great to "address all technical objections" but - in practice - there are often so many 
variables at play that doing so in a credibly neutral manner is impossible. Cost, however, is a 
single variable we can all reason about to at least a first approximation.

Rough consensus is just "exception processing" for people. When your running code already 
establishes economic consensus, you can leverage this to fund multiple different working groups 
with multiple approaches, removing the need to handle exceptions at the initial stage because 
you know it will be decided by actual use later on. This is not to say you 
don't <Link to="https://www.patreon.com/posts/online-community-47388851">need principles</Link>, 
just that you should think about ways by which you can encode those principles as economic 
incentives.

> "In other words, true north in software is often the direction that combines ambiguity and 
evidence of fertility in the most alluring way: the direction of maximal interestingness."

<Flash>

<Card>

Q: When running code already establishes economic consensus, do we need strong exception processing for people's technical objections such that we collectively explore only one option? Why?

A: No! Because *votes are funds*, so many different approaches can potentially be funded without addressing all technical objections in the preliminary stages.

</Card>

</Flash>

### Legibility

We tend to reject "rough" systems and opt for more orderly approaches. It was precisely this 
tendency - arising from the anxiety produced by ambiguity - which prompted Pete Resnick to write 
the above article. And now, we're saying it's not even about rough consensus. It's about however 
many projects can garner sufficient support because, in open protocols for money, a "vote" is an 
economic signal which can simultaneously be used to fund what is being voted on.

If you're objecting to the inevitable chaos of such an approach, it's time to talk about legibility.

James Scott's book, [*Seeing Like A State*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20186.Seeing_Like_a_State), describes how modern states reorganized societies to make them more legible to the apparatus of governance. As Rao describes it:

> "The state is not actually interested in the rich functional structure and complex behavior of 
the very organic entities that it governs. It merely views them as resources that must be 
organized in order to yield optimal returns. Importantly, this happens on both left and right: 
the failure mode is ideology-neutral: **it arises from a flawed pattern of reasoning rather than 
values**.

> "This style of thinking leads to simplification, since a reality that serves many purposes 
presents itself as illegible to a vision informed by a singular purpose [...] The deep failure 
in thinking lies is the mistaken assumption that thriving, successful and functional realities 
must necessarily be legible."

<Flash>

<Card>

Q: What kind of reasoning sees organic entities as resources to be organized in a legible way which yields uniformly high returns?

A: Flawed.

</Card>

<Card>

Q: What ideologies are most prone to employing such a flawed pattern of reasoning?

A: All of them.

</Card>

</Flash>

Don't misunderstand: there is - as always - a trade-off between "simple to understand" and 
"functionally useful", and there are some cases in which the first is genuinely useful. For 
instance:

> "The bewilderingly illegible geography of time in the 18th century, while it served a lot of 
local purposes, would have made modern global infrastructure, from the railroads (the original 
driver for temporal discipline in the United States) to airlines and the Internet, impossible."

We can learn a great deal from the history of states and the very human desire for legibility. 
It does, in some instances, lead to improvement. For instance, we should learn from the IETF 
that:

<Process>

Closure is more likely to be achieved quickly by asking for objections rather than agreement.

We should compromise between engineering choices, but not between people.

We must address issues and justify technical choices to the greatest extent possible.

Majority rule sucks.

We must use consensus as a tool, not an end.

We must build principled systems which cultivate our ability to make optimal collective choices.

</Process>

That said, we no longer operate in a version of the internet where rough consensus about a 
single way forward is even possible, let alone desirable. We need to embrace the generative 
chaos and **use economic code which establishes consensus to fund as many different approaches 
as is appropriate**, without treating humans as exceptions to be handled.

> "Reformers do not acknowledge (and often do not understand) that they are engineering a shift 
in optima and power, with benefits AND costs. Instead, the process is driven by a naive 'best 
for everybody' paternalism that genuinely intends to improve the lives of the people it affects."

Don't be a reformer. Build systems that help people govern themselves, and then - the most radical choice of all - **let them actually do so**.
