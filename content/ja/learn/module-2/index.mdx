# ðŸ’° The Global Financial System

After introducing you to the [way we will think](/learn/module-0/play-of-pattern) throughout 
this course and providing the example of [trust](/learn/module-0/trust/) in order to demonstrate 
what it means to keep complementary opposites always in mind, we then spent Week 1 exploring 
[value](/learn/module-1/value/) and [meaning](/learn/module-1/meaning/). These two critical 
concepts will inform how we play the rest of the nascent Web 3 patterns out over the next 6 weeks. 

We hope that you can already appreciate a little bit more deeply how to make meaning from the 
raw material of your life; not necessarily through grandiose action, but rather as the result of 
joyful little subversions along the way of real awareness and humility. A life lived wide awake 
naturally leads to various explorations of trust and value; the kinds of shared truth we preserve 
in narrative and pass between generations. Now that we have ownerless, borderless protocols for 
recording such history, we can potentially multiply the effects of thousands of little 
individual subversions into a more stable, global joy.

## Belly Laughs

The introduction might make you think this week will continue along the idealistic and abstract 
thread we have been drawing out. However, we're going to be diving deep into the guts of the 
financial system, various ways to read its history, and how it actually works today. We'll even 
throw in a balance sheet and a T account or two.  

We'll begin with a short introduction to asking better questions, because it really is worth 
asking about why systems are the way they currently are before moving straight into a disruptive 
mindset. From there, we'll take an extended journey - through the links between money and 
speech - into the very belly of the beast. Buckle up friends: it's gonna be a bumpy ride.
