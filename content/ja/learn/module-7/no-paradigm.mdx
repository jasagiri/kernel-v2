# ❌ No Paradigm

One concern in putting this module together has been language itself - in particular the word 
"sacred". Words like this have such inertia as a result of all the uses to which they have been 
put over the generations. They have been misused repeatedly in the service of violent and 
oppressive narrative structures which do not truly serve our species.

There is, to quote Douglas Rushkoff, *<Link to="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/139712.Nothing_Sacred" >Nothing Sacred</Link>*. 
Which also means everything is sacred.

What I most want to say here cannot be <Link to="https://youtu.be/7xwq1v8OD6s?t=255" >said</Link>. 
Instead, simply recognize that you cannot acquire everything, which is why any path to the 
sacred (meaning beyond yourself) has always had to do with letting go. We are not on a hero's 
journey. We are on <Link to="https://youtu.be/3HYlbg6RKMA?t=961" >a fool's errand to give back the evil which does not belong</Link> 
in this world.

*Without cause, God gave you being.*  
*Without cause, give it back.*

### How does this fit into Kernel?

We must take great care with the [language](/learn/module-0/money-language/#for-the-skeptics) 
we use to describe our [intentions](/learn/module-3/intention) when working with a global, 
shared and ownerless platform for computing. This is because the plot of our narratives is 
actually written in [economic code](/learn/module-2/money-speech/) 
and [executed without the context](/learn/module-0/money-language/#open-protocols-and-a-network-of-value) 
stories provide. The possibilities for the kinds of transactions we can enter into are 
therefore endless, but this is neither  a good nor a bad thing. It is simply a (very strange) 
fact of the time in which we live.  

As [Lewis Hyde showed](/learn/module-7/the-gift/#poetic-gifts-to-posterity), it is to the poets that we must 
turn to understand how to best craft this new tongue and use it in [service](/learn/module-5/incentives/#programming-crowds) 
of those to come, rather than our own self-aggrandizement.

_"Languages are not a barrier because the melodic contour of the song describes the nature of 
the land over which the song passes. **The rhythm is what is crucial** to understanding the 
song. Listening to the song of the land is the same as walking on this songline and observing 
the land."_

## Brief

Marianne Brün begins by discussing the tacit assumptions of a work on *The Structure of 
Scientific Revolutions* by Thomas S. Kuhn, along with the claims he makes about the term 
"paradigm" and the dilemma this lands him in, which she will unpick in the course of her essay.

> In short: its greatest dynamic power is held by a paradigm while it is not called *paradigm*, 
but called facts, data, truth, nature, ethics, proper procedures, etc. As soon as a paradigm is 
called a paradigm (usually then referred to as a *mere paradigm*), its power collapses.

Assumed knowledge, like heliocentrism or the existence of a particular God, creates the 
framework for investigation. However, it has throughout most of human history been

> a sin and crime, punished by law, church, and community vigilance, to ask and probe whether 
the known was true, whether philosophical thought and scientific research and problem-solving 
were based on all one could know.

We cannot sneer at this history, knowing that the people of bygone times acted in accordance 
with what they knew, and **could not** have suspected that much of their knowledge was based 
on flawed interpretations or faulty observations. Of course, this implies that

> We today can not tell, by definition, within which paradigm we are dwelling, thinking and 
acting, unless and until we are able to observe us and it from the outside, just as we 
recognize it and us from outside the times of Galileo.

In order to bypass the problem Kuhn created for himself above, Brün defines her stance:

> I shall use the word *paradigm* whenever I wish to speak of any structural notion and concept 
which, underlying the development of discourse, is tacitly taken for granted by all participants 
in that discourse, taken to go without saying and left unquestioned, regardless of whether the 
discourse leads to an agreement or a disagreement on any issue.

### The Inertia of Language

Our history can be seen as the retroactive telling of various paradigmatic stories;

> their inception, flourishing, and collapse; and how there always has been a new paradigm 
waiting to substitute for the collapsed one. These stories do not, however, sufficiently 
emphasize a recurrent and ubiquitous phenomenon [...] This phenomenon is best described as 
**the inertia of language**.

This inertia is both a symptom of paradigmatic stories, and the dynamic force behind their 
telling. It can be traced through facts like how the sun still "rises", even though we have 
known for hundreds of years that it is the Earth's horizon which dips into dawn, and rises 
into darkness.

> Due to this inertia, language stores and offers for communicative usage many <Link to="https://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/">remnants of many obsolete paradigms</Link>.

If we accept these remnants in what we write, speak or hear, then we subject ourselves to the 
unstoppable inertia behind it. This is something for which we must take **individual responsibility**:

> In human society language is so powerful that only violence can stop it. Where its power 
fails to serve my desires, it would be a mistake to blame such failure on the weakness of 
language. Rather I should blame the weakness of my relation to language. If I fail to notice 
that I think and speak, under the influence of language, in patterns and constructs accumulated 
and preserved in the junkyards of long since vanished paradigms, then this shows my lack of 
consciousness with regard to just that power with which language can quickly make me spokesman 
for ideologies, in which everybody is almost always “right” at the “wrong” time.

Q: The only way to act against the inertia of language formed in long-past paradigms in to take individual \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for the words we use.

A: responsibility.

</Card>

</Flash>

This rightness at the wrong time which reveals a lack of consciousness is made most obvious in a failure to appreciate context. Such contextual, environmental awareness is, however, more readily available in [indigenous protocols](https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/986506/7/Indigenous_Protocol_and_AI_2020.pdf):

> The work to reclaim language through these various mediums inaugurates the next leap between oral, written and textual mediums into the digital. But technology reveals what language reclamation solely through the discipline of linguistics lacks, that the creation of meaning cannot be programmed without context.

### Re-cognition

Ideologues always use language which insists on its own truth and consistency, yet is hostile 
to critique and frames the observed evidence as a betrayal of its believed premise. Ideologues 
believe in the power of language but fail to recognize it and so they become no more than the 
tools of their own ideologies:

> The accumulated language of bygone times: powerful, familiar, and obsolete, *uses the 
ideologists* and makes them its speakers. Through them it thwarts those specific human 
attempts which we call ideas and which, rebellious against all that is, would engender new 
thought and new procedures.

This brings us to the dilemma faced by authors like Kuhn:

> Neither insight nor good intention, not even syntactic and grammatical care, will protect me 
from becoming an ideologist as long as I am unable or unwilling to create the suitable language 
which speaks as I think and not louder than my thoughts.

Overcoming this begins by facing squarely the human misery and suffering in this world, seeing 
how it is largely created as a result of our culture, ethics, morals, beliefs and values and 
then attempting to join "the problem-solvers" so that we might stand ready for the day when

> The universal paradigm, in whose invisible and unquestioned embrace human misery can 
accurately be named a somehow excusable and certainly always expected commonplace, will stand 
exposed and rejected, to be replaced by one that I (from my present outlook) would prefer or 
(a radical change in social consciousness) by none.

We're arguing for the replacement of the paradigm which casts man-made suffering as an excusable 
certainty with **no paradigm at all**, rather than Brün's preference, but her following analysis is still on point.

### The Reward-oriented Hierarchy

> My conjecture is that we all live, speak, and act, perceive, judge, and decide under the 
unquestioned, untouchable, and firmly established guidance of an image which I call “the 
reward-oriented hierarchy”. By calling it so, I may be able to show that particular dynamic 
property of language which, undetected, blocks creative, and thus political, thought processes.

Brün makes a clear distinction between 

<Process>

The **premise** of any society, which is the satisfaction of all human needs *before and so that* 

The **purpose** of society can be envisioned, which is better means to meet our needs; the use of freedom from need for enjoyment of diversity and difference; the exploration of ideas; and the [implementation of inventions](https://vimeo.com/67076984).

</Process>

> We do not live in such a human society. Our society has developed an image of itself, 
according to which the satisfaction of needs has to be deserved and earned, so that it be 
understood as a reward [...] The premise of the reward-oriented hierarchy states that the 
necessities for the satisfaction of human needs are scarce. This scarcity poses individual 
and social problems of production and distribution. Finally, the premise declares that the 
problems of scarcity can not be solved before individual and social problems are solved.

Our present knowledge and technology could remove scarcity, but its **economics** and 
**language** linger on. This is *exactly why* [shared networks which merge the two explicitly](https://dougengelbart.org/content/view/191/) 
and allow us to program dynamic flows of value are fascinating. It's also why designing the incentive structures which support our shared computing surface according to [penalties rather than rewards](/learn/module-6/serenity/#aligning-incentives) is so critical. This is the last piece Brün was missing back in 1980. She already understood then what many still do not: 

> 💡 The problem is not primarily social or political. It is *linguistic and contextual*.

### On Your Marx

We cannot use the language of this reward-oriented hierarchy in which we are so deeply embedded 
to discuss its own premise: we must <Link to="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5ClmaG2tnPPFveZLH5lRrzV-Ndc3_Nli" >first teach it to experiment with itself</Link> in order to discover how it labors under the paradigm it ought to expose. 

> In particular: can we find the language whose grammar, syntax, and sentence structure would 
make it consistent with the premise that all human needs have to be satisfied first, *before 
and so that* individual and social problems can and will be identified and solved?

Brün quotes Karl Marx and shows how his analysis of labour may be applied to language to make 
a very subtle point about how insidious paradigms truly are. Though we can use Marxist analysis 
to reveal the contradictions of capitalism, showing that there are contradictions is not 
revolutionary. It is the contradictions themselves which are revolutionary because they 
generate the antagonisms which the system cannot resolve without disintegrating. Therefore, 
Marxist analysis is a great starting point, but what it lacks - and what Brün dreams of - is an [economy of signs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12jZtKiHH8hjSH-OMCuPqf0jbGZ3aLYJpGr7c_mBMQy4/edit?usp=sharing) largely free from the accumulated inertia of past paradigms.

<Card>

Q: The language we are developing is an economic one whose grammar, syntax, and structure will make it consistent with what premise?

A: Human needs must be fulfilled *before and so that* society can flourish.

### Measured Art

If we are to live up to Brün's dream of a society which solves human need as its premise, we must

> become the creative artists who compose language to teach its writers and speakers how to 
be thoughtfully and carefully *inconsistent* with undesirable premises, to be *incompatible* 
with the morals, the religions, the armed forces, the arguments of the reward-oriented hierarchy.

This kind of dream cannot be realised in natural language, no matter how eloquent:

> Communicative language is accumulated language based on obsolete and present paradigms and 
can not speak for those of us who think and dream in another paradigm.

We can turn again to David Graeber to understand what these kinds of inconsistent, incompatible ways of organizing might look like in both history and modern practice.

> Anarchist-inspired revolutionary 'networks' and 'convergences' employ decision-making processes which assume that no ideological uniformity can or should be possible. Rather, these forms become ways of managing a [diversity](/learn/module-7/giving/#further-afield), even incommensurability, which is **seen as a value in itself** [...] It is precisely what most outside observers take to be the foolishness and naivete of the movement (their apparent lack of coherent ideology) has turned out to be a token of their most sophisticated accomplishment and contribution to revolutionary theory [...] These [new forms of organization](https://dougengelbart.org/content/view/248/), which presume and are ways of articulating a diversity of perspectives, _are_ its ideology [...] They are a collection of approaches to social reality which are united not in their aspiration to impose themselves as the only legitimate approach, as if they were so many sects trying to seize power, but rather, by their shared commitment to a project and ethics which refuses to do so.

The refusal to adopt certain practices and products is an essential aspect of the three freedoms outlined in [The Dawn of Everything](/conversation/hospitality). The freedom to refuse, to disobey, is critical to reigniting our shared political imagination and finding better ways to live together outside the reward hierarchy and its imposition of a historical meta-narrative which centers progress and makes it seem as if the "inevitable" march towards it necessitates sacrificing what makes us truly human.

Because all of these briefs form one, [connected chain](/learn/module-6/) of thought - a digital <Link to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songline">songline</Link> of a different and human society - Brün finishes with a note about doubt, [humility](/learn/module-3/humility/) and [art](/learn/module-4/art/):

> Language is not the standard against which thinking is to be measured; on the contrary: 
language is to be measured by a standard it barely reaches, if ever, namely the imagery of 
human doubt and human desire [...]

> If the imagery succeeds in containing, anti-communicatively, for later, the simulation, the 
structural analogy to that which was found wanting, then, who knows, it may tell us or someone 
some day with breathtaking eloquence and in then simple terms what we, today, almost 
speechlessly have wanted so much.
