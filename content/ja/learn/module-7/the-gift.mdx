# üéÅ The Gift

<Video src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Kk2JVP-HKI8?start=240" />

> "One of the tragedies of modern life occurs when people go into aboriginal communities where 
there is a lively gift exchange and say, 'You know, logically, you could turn this into a 
commercial economy. If you just sold these things to one another, it would have the same 
effect.'' This destroys the community."

Perhaps we can reverse the above by building tools which allow us to present the commercial 
economy with the same dictum: "You know, logically, you could turn this into a gift economy. 
If you program reciprocal loops and recursive incentives, it would have the same effect," 
thereby discovering again what was [old community in new form](/learn/module-0/conversation/#old-gifts-anew)...

### How does this fit into Kernel?

There are many types of transactional exchange humans can enter into, and nearly all of them 
are required in a fully functional and healthy society. This talk has been selected because 
Lewis Hyde provides a balanced perspective on the place and importance of gift exchange within 
an economy, emphasizing the kinds of work and contexts in which it is most appropriate.

It should help you understand that this is not an idealistic module: it 
is [again a question of trade-offs](/learn/module-0/play-of-pattern/). The argument is not 
that we should abandon any kind of economic activity other than gift-giving; simply that gifts 
are the opposite extreme from purely commercial transactions and that we need to think carefully 
about where on the spectrum of possibility between our work best fits.

## Brief

> I had been introduced to the anthropology of gift exchange as a kind of economy and it struck 
me almost immediately that this was a language which could be used to talk about the situation 
of creative artists.

Hyde talks about his own biography and the notion that poetry, in particular, might have a 
different economy and the series of [questions](/learn/module-2/better-questions) this led 
him to:

<Process>

Why don't creative artists earn a living the way lawyers, doctors and computer scientists do?

Why do many artists feel a barrier between their work and the commercial world?

The anthropology suggests that there is an ethic, and therefore a set of obligations, which 
come with a gift. So, if you are a gifted person and are born with talents that are clearly 
not just created by your own efforts, but have been endowed upon you, are there obligations 
that come with that, and things that you're supposed to do with your gift?

Do communities have obligations to people who have been gifted in one way or another?

</Process>

### Connection, Circulation, Spirit

Hyde set out to read the anthropology, and many fairy tales and folk stories, about gift 
exchange. He came to three conclusions about gift-giving which differentiate it from market 
exchange.

<Process>

Gift giving **creates a connection** between [giver and receiver](/learn/module-7/giving/#receiving-gracefully). Gifts induce gratitude, 
and a consequent obligation towards relationship. This is the **cardinal difference** between 
gift and market exchange: part of the *great virtue of the marketplace is that there is no 
enduring connection*. Lewis gives as an example his travel to this presentation: his very 
mobility is enabled as a result of the _lack of relationships_ he needs to form. Gift exchange 
does not allow us to participate in this disconnected fashion. "This is a useful way to begin 
to think about the commerce of the creative spirit."

Gift exchange traditionally has much **wider circulations** than just that passed between 
two individuals, especially when gifts are given anonymously. Hyde quotes an Indian story of 
two women who decide to dispense with their alms-giving duties by only giving gifts to each 
other and who are consequently reincarnated as two wells with poisonous water. Another example 
is Thomas Hutchinson's phrase "Indian givers", arising from Puritan encounters with Native 
Americans who had a **different sense of what property is.** For these people, when you gave 
someone something, it wasn't theirs to keep: they had to pass it on. This perplexed the 
Puritans and so the phrase has come to mean someone who is insincere about gift-giving, but 
it *clearly means the opposite*: someone who understands the actual ethic of gift-giving, 
which is that **gifts flow through you, they are not yours to own**. You are their custodian. 
In fact, one functional definition of community is "a place where gift exchange can operate".

When property circulates as a gift, it **increases in value**, or it bestows **liveliness**. 
"There is some sense of increase, or of *something gaining life* as it circulates." Hyde talks 
about the fairy tale trope of being given seemingly worthless objects while traveling through 
the <Link to="https://youtu.be/GxVaxOco7kg?t=4307" >Land of Faerie</Link>, only to 
wake up the next morning and see that they are gold. "What seemed worthless in one community 
and state, turns out to be valuable in another community and state." The folktales tell of two 
responses: there are those who try to go back and get more, or figure out the price and cash 
in; and there are those who give the gift on. For the person who begins to count, to reckon 
the value of the gift; it turns back into ashes. For the other person, life becomes more lively. 
"There's a kind of trans-substantiation, or morality, implied in how you treat a gift." 
Like [Graeber](/learn/module-2/debt/#communal-credit), Hyde tells a Maori story in which the 
bounty of the forest from which you gather food is assumed to be a gift from nature and you 
must give part of it back to the forest, which is called "**feeding the spirit of the gift**. 
If you feed the spirit, all will stay lively and in motion".

### Poetic Gifts to Posterity

> There are poets whose lives matter to me; the fact that there are poets who have 
**given their life** to poetry matters to me; the fact that their work had entered my life was 
important and I felt gratitude towards these people for giving their lives to the work. 
Gratitude is a sign that, at some level, a gift has been given and received.

Many poets talk in this way about their practice. Eugenio Montale wrote in an essay about Dante:

> True poetry is always in the nature of a gift, in that it presupposes the dignity of its recipient.

Czeslaw Milosz wrote an essay about the different kinds of love described in Greek, in 
particular one type which is not often remembered: **storge**. This word denotes a tender care 
or affection uniting parents and children, and perhaps some teachers and their pupils. Milosz writes

> It is also not impossible that storge may be applied to the relationship between a poet and 
a generation of readers to come. Beneath the ambition to perfect one's art, without hope of 
being rewarded by contemporaries, lurks a magnanimity of gift-offering to posterity.

The idea that your work is not confined to the present moment and that you're working for some 
kind of larger, human world is wonderfully motivating. Lewis mentions a story about Bob Dylan 
from <Link to="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7800891-common-as-air">_Common As Air_</Link>, 
his book about creative cultural commons which we all co-own. When Dylan was 18, he was 
introduced by a friend to Woody Guthrie, who he quickly learnt to imitate perfectly. Dylan says:

> "Listening to Guthrie made me feel more like myself than ever before."   

> This is a perplexing statement, because [what is the self](/learn/module-4/self-enquiry) 
such that a young person would feel *like himself* in the presence of somebody else's art? 
It's as if that self is already present, but isn't brought to the surface until the art of 
some previous generation precipitates it [...] There is a feeling that there is a 
common <Link to="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oohg3LZd898&t=1344s">Self</Link>, 
that the hyper-individualism we live with today is not a full enough story to explain how an 
artist becomes an artist and comes to practice with his or her gifts.

### Anonymous and Lively

Hyde continues this theme with a story about Pablo Neruda, who - as a boy - was gifted a 
unique toy sheep anonymously, through a hole in the fence. He responded with his most precious 
possession: a pine cone. Years later, he would write these haunting words:

> To feel the affection that comes from those unknown to us, who are watching over our sleep 
and our solitude, over our dangers and our weaknesses: that is something still greater and 
more beautiful because it widens out the boundaries of our being and unites all living things.

> This exchange brought home to me, for the first time, a precious idea: that all humanity is 
somehow together. It won't surprise you, then, that I have attempted to give something resiny, 
earth-like and fragrant - something like a pine cone - in exchange for human brotherhood [...]

> This small and mysterious exchange of gifts remained deep inside me, deep and indestructible, 
giving my poetry light.

This points to a particular category of gift-exchange: the anonymous one. Often we know who has 
given us a gift, so we have a directed sense of gratitude. Anonymity [widens the field](https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/07/07/the-spell-of-the-sensuous-david-abram/) within 
which gifts operate, because if there is no obligation for reciprocity, how do you best respond? 

> üí° Gifts from beyond your sphere of influence can be given back beyond your sphere of influence.

<Flash>

<Card>

Q: Anonymous gifts must be given back to whom?

A: The more-than-human world.

</Card>

</Flash>

In almost all traditional gift-giving practices - as seen with the Maori practice of 'feeding 
the spirit of the gift' - the ultimate sphere of gift-giving is the bounty of nature herself, 
with regards to whom we all stand as recipients. In order to maintain and increase the value 
of the gifts we receive, we must treat them as gifts and give them on so that they remain 
*lively*. This is directly applicable to creative artists. May Sarton wrote:

> There is only one real deprivation, and that is not to be able to give one's gift to whom 
one loves the most. The gift turned inward, unable to be given, becomes a heavy burden, even 
sometimes a kind of poison. It is as though the flow of life were backed up.

Hyde also quotes the famous book *<Link to="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35476.Black_Elk_Speaks" >Black Elk Speaks</Link>*, 
which begins with dedication that illustrates how whatever wisdom Black Elk has **is not his**, 
and that - if you find it in his book - it is there to be given back to his ancestors.

> What is good in this book is given back to the six grandfathers.

This dedicated way of living contains a description of people who are "living the spirit of 
the gift", not trying to capitalize upon it, or bring it into the ego and claim it for their 
own. However, it is important to note that both are options and there is a negative side to 
gift-giving which can uphold oppressive structures and solidify - for instance - patriarchal 
power.

Q: Feeding the spirit of the gift and giving it on ensures that it remains \_\_\_\_\_\_.

A: lively.

### Tricky Trades

Hyde recalls *The Homeric Hymn to Hermes*, the original trickster, in which the key moment 
occurs when Hermes - having stolen Apollo's cattle, and being admonished by his mother - makes 
the point that if Zeus won't give him his due as an Olympian, he will steal it. All gift 
exchange communities are somewhat insular and, if you're excluded, your only practical option 
is to steal what you need. The key question is thus: *how does the outsider find a way in*?

There is another ancient Greek term which can help us here: the **hermion**, or gift of Hermes. 
It is the lucky find, the accident, the thing you stumble upon. It is the crossroads moment 
where two paths come together and, if you have the wit, you can make a work of art out of the 
accidental find. This is why cultivating serendipitous
, <Link to="https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/03/09/atom-and-archetype-pauli-jung/" >synchronous spaces</Link> is so important: they allow more and more outsiders to join the community of circulating gift exchange without resorting to theft.

<Flash>

<Card>

Q: By cultivating synchronous spaces with the [great gift of our time](/learn/module-7/scale-ability), we can find increasingly lucky ways to bring outsiders in and grow the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of circulating gift exchange.

A: community.

</Card>

</Flash>

### What Can We Do With All This?

> Just to become conscious of gift exchange is useful. To know that there is a spirit of the 
gift. To know there is a distinction between the 'connecting world' and the world that 
differentiates between people, and that we can choose to honour this spirit or not. To know we 
might have the kind of artistic practice which can initiate transformations in the soul; that 
can give us a taste of mystery and wilderness; that can help us bear our suffering; that can 
put us in touch with a kind of fertility which is not exhausted by using it up and that offers 
us a sense of an inhabitable world in which we have solidarity with what we take to be the 
source of our gifts.

> **To be conscious of this makes a difference**.

I will go a step further than Hyde: to ask what can be done with a gift and the knowledge of 
how it operates is to apply an alienating and utilitarian framework to something indigenous 
and [illegible](/learn/module-4/consensus/#legibility). It reminds me of Muriel Rukeyser:

> But there is one kind of knowledge ‚Äî infinitely precious, time-resistant more than monuments, 
here to be passed between the generations in any way it may be: never to be used. And that is 
poetry.

or Steve Biko:

> A visitor to someone‚Äôs house is always met with the question ‚ÄòWhat can I do for you?‚Äô. This 
attitude to see people not as themselves but as agents for some particular function is foreign 
to us. We are not a suspicious race. We believe in the inherent goodness of man. We enjoy man 
for himself. We regard our living together not as an unfortunate mishap warranting endless 
competition among us but as a deliberate act of God to make us a community of brothers and 
sisters jointly involved in the quest for composite answers to the varied problems of life.

Q: All Lewis Hyde is really asking us to do is to be what of gift exchange?

### One Last Link

Gift-giving extends deeply into both history and the human psyche. If you enjoyed this talk, you can find perhaps the ultimate exposition on this particular issue in The Diamond Sutra, otherwise known as the _Paramparamita_:

> And again, O Subh√ªti, a Bodhisattva should in such wise give his gift for the benefit of all beings. And why? Because, O Subh√ªti, [the idea](/learn/module-1/meaning/#the-heart-of-it) of a being is no-idea. And those who are thus spoken of by the Tath√¢gata as all beings are indeed no-beings.

In this particular text, too, we find an extension of the complementary opposites we have been examining for throughout our shared work. Each end of the spectrum, and the infinite range of probability between them is an idea, and is therefore also what Buddha once called ‚Äúno-idea‚Äù. So, we give our unique gift, we return our life whole-heartedly, in order to benefit all with whom we share it, never for a moment forgetting that - as long as we have in our minds any trace of the idea ‚Äúall beings‚Äù - we cannot in truth give anything.

> ‚ÄúAs _Prajna_ has been frequently the subject of discussion, I shall limit myself to the exposition of Dana, giving. It does not just mean giving in charity or otherwise something material in one‚Äôs possession as is usually understood when we talk of ‚Äògiving‚Äô. It means anything going out of oneself, disseminating knowledge, helping people in difficulties of all kinds, creating arts, promoting industry and social welfare, sacrificing one‚Äôs life for a worthy cause and so on. But this, however noble, Buddhist philosophers would say, is not enough as long as a man harbors the idea of giving in one sense or another. The genuine giving consists in not cherishing any thought of anything going out of one‚Äôs hands and being received by anybody else; that is to say, **in the giving there must not be any thought of a giver or a receiver**, and of an object going through this transaction. When the giving goes on thus in Emptiness, it is the deed of _Dana_, the first Paramita, flowing directly out of _Prajna_, the final Paramita.‚Äù
