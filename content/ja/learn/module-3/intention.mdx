# üîç Intention

So, you want to take back the web? From whom do you want to take it back? Why do you want to 
take it back? What will you do with it once it's been handed over to your care?

## Reflecting Truth

<AudioPlayer src="https://kernel-audio.s3.amazonaws.com/M3E1+-+Intention.mp3"/>

More seriously, we are conditioned to value action and results over intention. We live in a 
global culture that emphasizes what we achieve rather than what we mean.

Actions are, in a sense, how we attempt to make the external world match our internal world. 
They're important, and what you achieve matters, but it is not the primary matter. If you are 
not clear about your internal world - about what you mean to do - you will never be satisfied 
with the external world. Unless you examine your own expectations, you will always be disappointed.

How can you hope to improve the world if you do not know how to improve yourself?

Our action-oriented culture, driven by results, encourages us to believe that life is about 
what we can expect of the world. However, the reality is that an honest, reflective life is 
about responding truly, in every moment, to what the world expects of you. This is only possible 
if you constantly practice awareness of your intentions.

This primary focus on intention and expectation is inspired by Viktor Frankl's 
book <Link to="https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/05/17/yes-to-life-in-spite-of-everything-viktor-frankl/" >Man's Search for Meaning</Link>, 
but you can find some version of it across nearly all the world's major wisdom traditions. We 
need not express it using spiritual or psychological language though, because this is all about 
developing the patterns of thought most well-suited to our particular context.

What's unique about web3 - about economic code which creates new trust spaces; expands the 
possible definitions of value; merges money and speech; and creates new constraints in which to 
experiment with freedom - is that we can **encode our intentions**, literally. Most importantly, 
the code with which we express our inner world and meaning then lives independently of us on a 
shared, global network where it will not change.

Revolutions always end up failing because they are reliant on people whose priorities change. There is something ambiguous in each of us, and this is a wonderful thing. However, a smart contract I wrote that expresses a particular [economic ideal](https://etherscan.io/dapp/0x5bCF2767F86f14eDd82053bfBfd5069F68C2C5F8#readContract), which is now deployed on mainnet, will remain there irrespective of what happens to me. There is no bribe or threat which can get me to change this. I literally cannot take it back, even if my life depends on it. It is the combination or integration of our own ambiguity in dialogue with shared, verifiable media that is most interesting here.

Placing our attention first on our own intentions retrieves our ability to make meaning, to live purposefully, and to "participate in reality creation" as Douglas Rushkoff writes in [Team Human](https://www.teamhuman.fm). Cultivating honesty about who you really intend to be - the kinds of meaning you truly wish to enact in your world - is the most direct path to experiencing a deeper sense of your "self", which is nothing other than the same essence which you share with all life. From this place, which is both reflective and collective, we can create technologies that work **with** us; that complement our pre-existing and [innately valuable humanity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EDL34MrlOnIgr3j0gkp7cHPh5Ja6UW23YSe8nzuXsGk/edit?usp=sharing). 

Timechains which encode intention over durations we cannot readily imagine are an invitation to be honest and clear about what meaningful money really is in our own experience, and to express the courage required to sign - and [go on signing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12jZtKiHH8hjSH-OMCuPqf0jbGZ3aLYJpGr7c_mBMQy4/edit?usp=sharing) - that into shared reality.
