Weâ€™ve looked in detail at our first two pillars of the week: how we might augment our ability to think for ourselves using transformative tools which are public goods of the sort capable of shifting cultural values; and how we might create more time for ourselves by both being present now and understanding the histories from which we come. Now, we turn to a presentation given by Juan Benet, in which he shows how "Web 3" relates to a larger movement happening across the internet right now, aimed at **re-imagining how we share and relate**. As such, it forms the third pillar of how we "take back the web" - **cooperation baked into the very protocols** we use for collecting, storing, and consulting the shared record which Vannevar Bush spoke of in 1945.

## How does this fit into Kernel?

This week's curated materials have all tried to identify and draw out a particular stream of 
thought that predates the internet. This is because the internet is just the latest in a long 
line of attempts to collect and make navigable the sum total of human knowledge. Access to this 
shared record and the means to move through it meaningfully confer great power. We have a unique 
opportunity as a generation to ensure both record and means remain open to all.

In particular, this video will help you understand more about

## Brief

### Introduction

Web 3 is a part of a larger phase transition in our internet (and our society) in which we're 
moving from a pre-computing to a post-computing civilization. This is happening at break-neck 
speed in terms of the evolutionary history of our species, though it simultaneously feels slow 
to us as individuals now used to communicating at light-speed with anyone, anywhere. Think of 
it in terms of **periodic waves:** 

- mainframes
- computers 
- GUIs 
- the internet
- the web
- web 2.0
- mobile
- blockchains
- web 3

Q: The internet is the latest wave in a periodic series, all created by our attempts to collect and make navigable the sum total of what?

A: human knowledge.

Can you imagine where we'll be in 40 years? Exact developments in this sort of 
timeframe are extremely difficult to predict. As Juan says,

> **"The choices that we make in the technologies we build - the properties we give our 
products - will have drastic implications not just for ourselves, but for many people in the 
future."**

He then details the key questions which define and constrain the superpowers bestowed by each 
new wave. We include them in full here because we feel they can serve as the beginning of a useful framework for your own thought when encountering new tools and thinking about their possible effects, both technological and cultural:  

- How do they work?
- How reliable and correct are they?
- How open and accessible are they?
- How safe are they?
- How can they fail?
- Who controls them and how are they governed?
- What rights do they secure/guarantee/grant people?

> "We must be very careful about the things we build. We should care about maximizing human 
potential; promoting rights; and the long-term flourishing of humanity when thinking about the 
technologies we create."

### History

There is a difference between "the internet": the wires and networking protocols which evolved 
mostly from military and academic work from the 1960's and 70's onward; and "the web": 
hyperlinked documents, static pages, browsers and everything youâ€™re most likely used to.

#### **Web 1 (**1991 to 2000)

Mostly static, read-only content. This also marks the beginning of "online" commercial activity.

#### **Web 2** (the early 2000's)

Its key characteristic is its dynamic, interactive nature as opposed to the largely static 
content of the 90's. It's often described as "the read-write web" and is more participatory, 
social, and market-based. This includes not only Facebook and Twitter, but also services like 
Uber and AirBnB. However, 

> **The advertising model in Web 2.0 is broken.** It optimizes for time spent on pages and tries 
to keep people and their data locked in. Anger is a great way to generate clicks, so we're 
increasingly optimizing for negative emotions in order to pay the bills.

#### Web 3 (now)

This next iteration of the web gives us read, write and [trust](/learn/module-0/trust/). 

Web 1.0 was about linking content together. Web 2.0 was about linking programs to that content 
and building rich, dynamic applications which work across our devices. Web 3.0 is about linking 
content and programs directly to each other, removing intermediaries and gaining public 
verifiability. Web 3.0 is turning centralized applications into decentralized protocols.

Q: What model in Web 2.0 is broken?

Advertising.

<Card>

Q: What feature does Web 3 add which can be used to fix the shortcomings of Web 2?

A: Trust.

### The path forward

The aim for us should be to take what Bitcoin did to money and do it to all kinds of services 
and applications. Bitcoin "thawed the peer-to-peer winter and reminded everyone that we can 
build these kinds of systems and succeed." Now, it's time to hook into the larger movement 
happening across the internet to change how the web itself works: how we store, retrieve and 
consult the shared record of human knowledge. 

The simple property of **verifiability** is the key to all this. The "ability to check" is as 
powerful as the ability to hyperlink text in your documents was in Web 1.0. It's a new kind of 
linguistic primitive. Few understand <Link to="https://unifying.thebluebook.co.za/?stackedPages=%2Fstructure">this</Link>, similar to how hyperlinks were misunderstood early in protocol development. 

### Free thought

**It is not just blockchains.** It's "the decentralized web" in general. Blockchains systematize 
economics and law, and did not actually start on the web - Bitcoin was a protocol built to run 
separately without needing a browser. So a big part of Web 3 work is to make these things 
actually talk to each other: **to make blockchains accessible to people**.

<Flash>

<Card>

Q: What simple property of Web 3 is as powerful as the hyperlink?

A: Verifiability.

</Card>

</Flash>

This goes to the heart of safer, more resilient, and more ethical protocols which can literally 
encode social contracts in ways which are visible and meaningful to the people using them.

**Open services** and **market protocols** are what we're really able to build in Web 3.0. The 
old economic truths which sank open source peer-to-peer software in the past are no longer true. We can 
now create commodities out of things that were fixed resources: i.e. storage, computation, and 
bandwidth. This will allow peer-to-peer to compete with centralized alternatives.

Smart contract systems are the basis of [jurisdictions](/conversation/#roots). They are computable law and it is 
unlikely that we will tap the full potential of this for many years to come. So, if you want to 
bake rights into your systems and "lock the web open" as many of us do, then think about what it 
means to encode rules into the jurisdiction of the internet, because that's what is really 
happening here.  

In a way, the internet is becoming a nation. See J. P. Barlow's <Link to="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence">Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</Link>.

<Card>

Q: More ethical and resilient products, and new kinds of jurisdiction, both rely on us using the unique features of Web 3 to build what?

A: Open services and market protocols.

### The other web 3

The people who built the linked data, semantic web actually coined the term "Web 3" back in 2004. This idea was 
started by **Tim Berners-Lee**, and is aimed at making everything interoperable, removing 
intermediaries and decentralizing the control of information. His approach has been to model 
ontologies and data so as to connect computers on the machine-readable web.

The most successful Linked Data work ended up powering the Knowledge Graph and the Facebook Open 
Graph, which is a far cry from the decentralized vision which started it all. Much like the work 
on transformative tools for thought, this is due to issues around funding public goods which - 
if nothing else - blockchains can genuinely help solve.

The decentralized web movement, the blockchain movement, and the linked data movement are all 
part of Web 3. **We're in it to build a permanent, ownerless, and borderless foundation for this 
connected global community of which we are all a part.**
