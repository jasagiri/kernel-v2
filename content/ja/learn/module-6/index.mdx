# ⚖️ Scaling Principled Games

It's easy to lose your bearings when describing a planetary-scale, decentralized, [networked virtual machine](/learn/module-1/) which provides a shared, ownerless computing 
surface on which we can run the [global financial system](/learn/module-2/); [reimagine the web](/learn/module-3) and our [organisational customs](/learn/module-4); alter 
the [incentives which power society](/learn/module-5) and ultimately create the 
interpersonal [trust](/learn/module-0/trust) required to [play](/learn/module-0/play-of-pattern) 
[principled](https://getdweb.net/principles), infinite games with each other.

Last week we asked you what constitutes [persuasion](/learn/module-5/incentives/#persuasion) 
and argued that it is language which performs what it says. We've highlighted how economic 
code which distributes [value](/learn/module-1/value/) by virtue of how it is expressed 
constitutes a [new class of performative speech acts](/learn/module-4/self-enquiry/#signature-performances) 
of a most [meaningful](/learn/module-1/meaning/) kind. Hopefully, you're beginning to see how 
this course is itself a kind of chain: each module [linked](/learn/module-3/lock-it-open/#the-path-forward) 
in ever greater detail to the [ones before](/learn/module-3/time/); each piece within each 
week [indebted](/learn/module-2/debt/) to [many others](/learn/module-4/the-garden) 
which [transform it](/learn/module-3/remember/) from something which stands alone into part of 
a bigger, [digital](/learn/module-4/art/) [picture](/learn/module-0/purpose/).

## Mirror Play

This week is an opportunity for simple [reflection](/learn/module-3/humility/). Kernel is 
built around "ever-green" content and so, while there is a great deal of information about 
scaling and staking <Link to="https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news" >available</Link>, 
we'll only cover the Eth2 Design Rationale and 
the [promised Bret Victor video from Week 1](/learn/module-1/joyful-subversion/#experiment-with-format), 
both balanced by an old Spanish poetic idea. 

Take your time, enjoy the serene pace, and let's co-create some beautifully principled games to 
play with one another.
