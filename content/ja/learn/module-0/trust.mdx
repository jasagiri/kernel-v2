description: The meanings of words are arrived at without trusting intermediaries. Blockchains instantiate this same phenomenon for any programmable transaction. We all know what 'love' signifies, but it takes real relationship to experience its deeper meaning. Exploring these kind of new 'trust spaces' is what Kernel is all about.

# ‚úçÔ∏è Trust

What is trust? Who do you trust and why? Would a world without trust be richer or poorer?

## Liars and cheats

Bitcoin began with the maxim **"Don't trust, verify"**. 

That is, trust can only begin where verification ends. Trust is only *meaningful* once we have 
fully understood how people can lie. 

Because we can codify the ways in which it is possible to cheat, we can also write executable 
software rules, with deterministic results, that prevent cheating in the protocols we use to 
define and transfer value. 

This demonstrates how to use [complementary opposites](/learn/module-0/play-of-pattern) as a 
mode of thought to identify patterns of meaning. We can build protocols with strong trust 
guarantees by defining clearly, **and encoding**, what it means to lie. To understand trust, 
you must know the details of all possible deceptions.

These [clearly defined and encoded rules](https://github.com/jimmysong/programmingbitcoin/blob/master/ch07.asciidoc) **do not** mean we need no longer trust at all. It means that 

> üí° there is an *implicit shift* from trusting those who own the media by which we transfer 
value, to those with whom we are actually transacting.

Take a moment to reflect on this statement.

## Vires in numeris

The above is another early Bitcoin maxim which means "Strength in numbers". 

It goes back to Pythagoras, for whom "All things are number". The implicit shift towards 
trusting those we're actually transacting with is enabled due to a fundamental change in the 
language by which value is defined. Instead of regulatory fiat, enforced by legal prose and 
human courts backed by the threat of violence; Bitcoin enables a network of peers to create 
the conditions required for a functional currency through mathematics alone, enforced by 
deterministic computation.

The saying holds this _double entendre_ which implies both that using numbers and mathematical 
consensus gives us the strength to lay down what Andreas Antonopoulos will later call 
'unassailable facts', while also pointing at that which gives power and meaning to any narrative: 
the community which believes it. The more succinctly we can express shared truths, the easier 
it becomes to verify (and therefore trust) the systems we use. This implies that

> üí° Trust has something to do with truth. 

Publicly verifiable truth means more humans can reach consensus on the basic state of their 
shared realities and get on transacting in increasingly valuable ways based on new kinds of 
trust. 

It's a **profound feedback loop**: use a universal language (math) to define succinctly what it 
means to cheat, enforce penalties in a deterministic and executable way based on your definitions 
(code), which allows more humans to experiment with interpersonal trust in ways previously 
unimaginable.

To dream up important ideas you must think like an idealist; to build systems that will live up 
to those dreams, you must [think like an adversary](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/the-questions-concerning-technology).

## Access-ability

Ultimately, we're not interested in trust based on blind faith. We're interested in deterministic 
verifi**ability** between peers. The Bitcoin source code can be audited by anyone, anywhere in 
the world - so it's not just ability we're interested in here, but also **access**. Trust, in a 
practical day-to-day sense, has a lot to do with transparency and education. 

This requires a certain kind of architectural innovation in the very structure of money: no more 
clients and servers; everyone needs to be a peer. Please read the next piece of curated 
material - [Money Talks](/learn/module-0/money-language) - to get a sense for what a 
peer-to-peer architecture of money is, and what money _as a protocol_ might come to mean in 
our time. As Nicky Case highlights below, it all comes down to this fundamental game theoretic 
insight:

We **are** each others' environment.

### Deeper down the rabbit hole

Of course, all this raises the question, "What is truth?" Note that we're interested in 
*shared truths* above, i.e. consensus. Absolute Truth is beyond the scope of this course, though 
you can use the same framework to think about it. One does not approach an absolute by trying 
to define it, but through being clear about *what it is not*. If you are honest and clear enough, 
then whatever is left over after all your [negation](https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/SSR/article/viewFile/202/181) 
must necessarily be the truth.
