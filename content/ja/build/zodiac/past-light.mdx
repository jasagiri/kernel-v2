# Session I

While networks have existed throughout history, new information technology emphasizes cooperative relations that greatly impact institutions, by cutting across jurisdictions and through markets. In this session, we'll be looking at the 19th Century roots of cooperativism, relating that to various different historical developments online and then looking to different kinds of guilds and the informal economic systems they have established in order to navigate the needs of human beings living, working and playing together in a networked world.

After this, we'll deploy our very own DAO and vote on a few proposals as a means of becoming more familiar, in a hands-on way, with what the future of cooperation and collaboration could look like. Because guilds require diverse and complementary player skill sets over extended time periods, “It matters that the same people work together again”. We look forward to participating with you as we investigate together new cultural models for more connected relationships.
