## DAOs and Dragons

During KB5, we took a slightly different approach when deploying our own DAO. We used our DAO to experiment with various different ideas for organisation, weaving the lessons we learned into a few basic insights from which a more complete DAO pattern language can be born.

In order to achieve this, we came up with a number of Dungeons and Dragons-like prompts which we could use to "accelerate" the experience of our DAO, deciding how we would respond and then using those responses as the basis to think of healthy patterns real-world DAOs can employ to handle different situations that may occur at different levels of scale in their own evolution. You can find all the prompts we put together [here](https://gnosisguild.notion.site/fd0178c1d2eb429695542ac00010df3f?v=9e866414fc524711bbd0aae320b02415) as well as recordings of each of the sessions below:
