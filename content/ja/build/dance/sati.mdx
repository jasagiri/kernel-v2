# Re-membering

We offer here a selection of audio clips recorded during Kernel Block 6, otherwise known as the empty block. Each meditation moves through one of the traditonal pillars of "sati", a Pali word which is often translated as "mindfulness", but which really means something more like "memory", or "remembrance". Beginning in the body, please join us for a slow stroll nowhere in particular.

Simply come along, and we can investigate together that nature of emptiness and enjoy the harmony of silence.

You need nothing to listen meaningfully to these sessions. No prior experience is required, nor do we promote any particular technique. We just sit together and delight in sharing time.

## Anapana - Breath and Rupa - Body

Generally these are done separately, but we did not record the first session and so included pointers to both in our second session, provided below:
