## Liquid Learning

DeFi is such a dynamic phenomenon that it is difficult to structure clear and evergreen content for it. Moreover, many of the presentations given in KERNEL on this topic do not get recorded by speaker request. However, we collect here on this page the recordings we do have, as well as a series of discussion held in KB5 meant to orient you towards best practices and intentional development using these exciting new financial primitives.

### MEV

There are so many concepts to understand in DeFi that it is difficult to pick out where to start. For those of you serious about building stuff, we feel that understanding more about Miner Extractable Value is a great place to begin because it genuinely is new and different to any other financial environment we have ever created, and so understanding this will help you understand most everything else you need to in order to build constructive and beneficial services in this brave new world.
