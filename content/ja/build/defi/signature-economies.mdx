# Signature Economies

Following on from the thread outlined in **Funding Goods and Good Funding**, we present here some deeper thinking on the question, "Why?" 

Why are we actually interested in building new financial tools and to what ends can we direct them? What would it mean for money to be a [measure of care](/learn/module-2/engineering/#further-references)? Is it truly possible, as [Niran Bablola talked about in a KB5 Fireside](https://youtu.be/XQ98r6U-KGY?t=2734), that the real root of value is not ownership at all, but participation in collective action?

DeFi can be a force that encourages constructive, distributive and equtiable particpation; or it can simply entrench further the unjust inequalities we all currently experience, and the extractive, acquisitive mindset we all currently suffer from. Again, you will find articles and perspectives online that lend credence to either view. We are not interested in only one of the complementary opposites in Kernel: we endeavour to see both sides with integrity and - by dint of our own creativity and response-ability - to choose with humility to more fertile direction.

As such, we are exploring various experiments - such as [FreeLearn](/blog/community/free-learn) - and present here another experiment, alongside some deeper thoughts about narrative which may be applicable to more long-term views of the DeFi phenomenon.

## Token Narratives

A module 5 fireside from kb5 that may take you into some interesting thoughts about the archetypal structures behind more interesting and less extractive financial mechanisms.
