## Funding Goods and Good Funding

One of the legitimate and pressing questions to ask of the DeFi world is simply, "Why?" Why are we working on more efficient financial tools if the world we live in is largely the result of optimising for efficient financial tools with little regard for externalities which cannot easily be quantified and bundled up with neat, numeric representations?

As such, we include in this section a few pages devoted to innovative ways of thinking about funding and grants which use the mathematical models and game theoretic incentive structures being created in DeFi with the specific aim of creating and distributing money in more equitable, inclusive and diverse ways. 

We remain of the opinion that it is not simply enough to criticise from the sidelines: there are genuinely innovative and interesting things happening in the world of DeFi and it is up to us, who care, to integrate that into the wider, wilder world in order to create a genuinely better web3.
