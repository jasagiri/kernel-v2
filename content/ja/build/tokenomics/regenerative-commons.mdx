# Regenerating Communal Commerce 

Celo’s mission is to build a financial system that creates the conditions for prosperity for everyone. In this special holiday edition of the tokenomics guild, we will be asking ourselves how Celo's tokenomics help it bring crypto to the global south and other emerging markets and realise such lofty ambitions.

## Preparation

1. [An overview of Celo](https://medium.com/celoorg/an-introductory-guide-to-celo-b185c62d3067)
2. [More in-depth readings on Celo’s stability mechanism](https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/stability)
3. [A recent interview from Marek on mobile-first Web3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItREmpQNORI)
4. Another [good intro from Nansen](https://www.nansen.ai//research/celo-toward-blockchain-mainstream-adoption) whose main addition to this conversation is the comparison in usage between mobile-first apps on Celo (like Ube) and not-mobile first apps from Ethereum that can also be used on Celo (Sushi). The mobile first apps do much better.
