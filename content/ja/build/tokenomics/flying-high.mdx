# Noble Networks

Helium is decentralized wireless infrastructure. At nearly 300,000 base stations deployed in just over 2 years, no wireless data carrier has ever grown so quickly. This was possible by incentivizing the participation of tens of thousands of individuals around the world through a new layer one blockchain and token, and a powerful meme about connectivity so affordable, ubiquitous, and decentralized that any device could afford to be connected.

In this Junto we will discuss the value of the Helium network, their novel Proof of Coverage security model, and what we can learn from Helium that could be applied to other real-world applications of blockchain.
