# Mounting Up

Each week, we will share various preparatory materials which you will need to read through or listen to in order to familiarise yourself with the topic to be discussed. Tokens, and mechanism design more broadly, present us with an infinite design space, and it is a space we wish to dive deeply into with experts from across the world.

These are sessions intended for informed conversation which is tailored and specific to the people we invite. However, this doesn't mean the sessions are serious or heavy. We just think that the most fun and playful conversations arise when you are already familiar with at least some parts of the jungle gym.

## Preparation

This first guild will focus on OlympusDAO and the token OHM, which has some really neat game-theoretic underpinnings. We'll also take a look at KlimaDAO, who have forked Olympus' strategy and aim to create ecosystem of projects building with programmable carbon.

OlympusDAO began because we still do not have an independently valued digital currency and seeks to solve this by asking the question, "What if we could achieve stability while still maintaining a floating market-driven price?"

In line with the introduction to this guild, OHM's careful design has allowed the community to make a particularly potent meme from a fairly dry and technical concept: (3,3) is no longer just an expression understood by those who know what the [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma), but signifies in an easily-sharable way the notion of win-win incentive structures.

In addition to this, the mechanism has ensured that OlympusDAO owns nearly all their own liquidity, which is significantly different to most other DeFi projects.

A quick overview of KlimaDAO from johnx25bd in Kernel slack:

- In Klima, each $KLIMA is backed by 1 tonne of carbon, in the form of **BCT**, or a "Base Carbon Tonne".
- **BCT** is a carbon index token backed by a basket of tokenized carbon offsets from legacy registries like Verra.
- The Toucan Protocol is the infrastructure that enabled the creation of **BCT**: a Carbon Bridge and Carbon Pools.
- The Carbon Bridge enables people to tokenize their legacy offsets and bring them onto a smart contract platform (in this case Polygon) as "tokenized carbon", or **TCO2**.
- They can then deposit **TCO2** tokens into a Carbon Pool and receive carbon index tokens like **BCT**. This creates a more liquid asset, necessary for a project like Klima to build with.
- But KlimaDAO is just the start â€” we aim to build an ecosystem of projects building with programmable carbon.
