# Identifying Key Leverage Points

At the end of our last workshop we brainstormed things that we'd like to regenerate. We reduced these down into five primary dimensions of regeneration:

* Earth
* Interspecies
* Individual
* Community (Relationships)
* Organizations (Education and Governance)

For the second workshop, we'd like to identify key leverage points for each of these dimensions of regeneration. As [Donella Meadows said](https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/), 

> These are places within a complex system (a corporation, an economy, a living body, a city, an ecosystem) where a small shift in one thing can produce big changes in everything.
