# Principled Patterning

## Purpose

> As we build this consensus economy, it‚Äôs our privilege and responsibility to deeply consider the design patterns, tools and language we adopt.

As our beloved cryptowanderer says, human beings are moral creatures who learn. We have the unique ability to *intend* ‚Äî¬†to conceive of the consequences of our actions and organize to realize certain outcomes. This is the essence of coordination. We find mutual agreement (somehow), and work together to realize a vision. 

The regeneration movement holds the vision to foster a societal transformation so that all humans can thrive in harmony with the Earth. We are not here to "save the world". The world will be fine. Instead, the depth and breadth of life on Earth is at stake.

Our task is to envision the future we want to see realized ‚Äî¬†the timeline we want to play out on Earth ‚Äî¬†and discern what we each can do, now, to maximize the likelihood of it playing out.

## Objectives

Through the Regeneration Guild, we will: 

1. Surface a holistic, multidimensional definition of "regeneration", honoring each perspective and understanding that we will hold different value-sets ‚Äî¬†finding intersubjective consensus,
2. Delve into our system of systems and identify key leverage points that hold exceptional potential to catalyze a rapid, graceful transition to a regenerative paradigm,
3. Reflect on our own "loci of control" ‚Äî¬†what is within our power to change.

As an outcome, we hope to make a bit more sense of what a regenerative economy will look like and outline a credible path to bringing it about. 

## Preparation

To prepare for our first workshop, we recommend familiarizing yourself with:

1. [A General Framework for Analyzing Sustainability of Socio-Ecological Systems](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-General-Framework-for-Analyzing-Sustainability-of-Ostrom/39c3a529768cd7fe77e178cae10377085c84cfc8), Elinor Ostrom (2009);
2. [Greenpilled: Ch 1](https://greenpill.party/preview.pdf), Kevin Owocki (2022);
3. [Podcast: Regenerative Futures with Kate Raworth](https://www.flourish-book.com/flourishsystemschange-podcast/regenerative-futures), Kate Raworth, Sarah Ichioka, and Michael Pawlyn (2022);
4. [The nine planetary boundaries](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries/the-nine-planetary-boundaries.html), Stockholm Resilience Centre;
5. For inspiration, [Video: Five Features of Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAL3L4-7r0M), Sep Kamvar (2018);

Some questions to ponder:

1. How are Complex Intentional Systems distinguished as a subset of Complex Adaptive Systems?
2. What is the role of a regenerative financial system to underpin a regenerative economy? What are the limits of finance?
3. How can we [embed intention](https://hackernoon.com/policy-proposals-for-crypto-protocols-to-make-them-less-dystopic-and-more-inclusive) into our financial infrastructure, so it best serves human flourishing?
4. With [opt-in, substantive laws created on Ethereum](/learn/module-1/dreamers/#learning-the-language), how does this change the mode and method of governance? How do we craft digital infrastructure that conscious people want to choose to dwell in, acknowledging that the spaces that we occupy characterize the tone of our interactions?
5. What do you feel needs regenerating? What are some metrics for monitoring that regeneration?
6. Is it possible for something to be "too healthy"?
