# Regeneration

> We need [applied poetics](https://mspapic.medium.com/evolution-is-an-act-of-art-ec3c872b1d28) [...] we must be poetic. We must reimagine the bridge not as a thing but as **a system of tensions**. We must understand what it feels like to both reach, and to support.

The Regeneration Guild is meant to be a guided onramp to the Web3 regeneration movement. ðŸŒ±

> It makes no sense in the least to think that art and science, or that art and farming, are not intertwined. Ask anyone what makes their colleague truly brilliant and itâ€™s usually in their innovative and unique way of approaching a challenge. That innovation or singular approach requires a kind of internal poetry. Someone can teach you the laws of physics, but no one can exactly teach you which ones to question. [Schools can teach you but they canâ€™t make you curious](/learn/module-6/learn/#a-surprisingly-educated-public).

The Regeneration guild is a series of workshops on life, growth, the shared soil which is the root of our humility, and how becoming ever more conscious of our interdependent being necessarily implies living in regenerative movement, still at peace with our indivudal parts, and with a collective focus on common principles, patterns and values.

Weâ€™ll be looking at everything from resilient resources to sacred economics as we explore tools, practices, and crafts which will help us live in balance, harmony, and health.

> To be sure, no one person or program defines a movement, but each one plays an integral part. The systems design we seek is in not in a manual, nor in the soil, nor in a lab alone. The regenerative process lives in our hearts, in our very desire to keep trying even when our plans get re-written by fate.

_The whole wide world we traverse with our thoughts_  
_And nothing that humans find is more dear than self._  
_Since, oh, so dear, the self to others is,_  
_Those who know the love of self_  
_Must harm no other being._
