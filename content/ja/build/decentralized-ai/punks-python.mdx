# Of Punks and Python Libraries

In this session, we'll take a look at a live dataset on Ocean (the cryptopunks images) and will discuss the legitimacy of various kinds of data. Then we'll dive into the Ocean Python library and speak a bit about private keys, sample data and how to simplify all the steps we'll walk through for those who follow us.

## Preparation

- Take a look at the [cryptopunks dataset on Ocean](https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:C9D0568838fa670baEe7195Ea443b32EfCAc2281).
- (Stretch goal) consider how [data scientists collaborate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06684).
