# Into The Ocean

In our first session, we will create a plan for future weekly sessions and then go through the process of publishing a dataset/algorithm on testnet. To start, we will use UI tools with no code, so this tutorial is suitable for non-technical people interested in data science/AI on Web3.

## Preparation
